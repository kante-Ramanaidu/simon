# Simon Game 🎮

A modern web-based version of the classic **Simon Memory Game**, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 What is the Simon Game?

Simon is a memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of button presses (with corresponding sounds and colors). It's a great way to test and improve your short-term memory skills!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click the **Start Game** button to begin.
2. The game will flash a color and play a sound — this is the beginning of the sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the **same order** as they are shown.
4. After each correct sequence, the game adds one more step.
5. If you click the wrong color, the game ends — press **Start** again to try from level 1!
